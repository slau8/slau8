### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shannon Lau, a software engineer and creative technologist. Let's build human-centered experiences, together.

I'm hyped about ubiquitous technologies with functional design. Cameras, headphones, smart devices, electric skateboards â€” if it turns on, it's fair game. My vision is to reimagine and expand these tangible experiences.

Most recently, I interned with [Reality Labs at Meta](https://tech.fb.com/codec-avatars-facebook-reality-labs/), developing the Codec Avatars Project.
