### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shannon Lau, a software engineer and multidisciplinary creator. Let's build human-centered experiences, together.

I'm hyped about ubiquitous technologies with functional design. Speech-to-text tools, cameras, headphones, fitness trackers, electric skateboards, and more â€” Iâ€™m envisioning a future where these tools feel so intuitive in our daily flow, that they almost fade into the background. Our focus remains grounded in the present, on the beauty of our everyday, and in the spaces where we feel truly connected.
