### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shannon Lau, a software engineer and multidisciplinary creator. Let's build human-centered experiences, together.

I'm hyped about ubiquitous technologies with functional design. Cameras, headphones, smart devices, electric skateboards â€” if it turns on, it's fair game. My vision is to reimagine and expand these tangible experiences.

Currently, I'm engineering safer, smarter, and connected streets with [Cavnue](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/reports-data/success-stories/cavnue-cav-corridor/).
