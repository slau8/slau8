### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shannon Lau, a design-driven software engineer and creator focused on building human-centered experiences.

Iâ€™m hyped about technology and hardware that leverages functional design. Cameras, speakers + headphones, electric skateboards â€” anything with a power button is fair game. I enjoy building software that interfaces and complements these tangible products.

Most recently, I interned with [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/codec-avatars-facebook-reality-labs/) working on the Codec Avatars Project.
